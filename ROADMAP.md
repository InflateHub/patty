---

## 0.5.0 — Food Log ✓

- [x] Photo capture / upload per meal entry
- [x] Optional text note per entry
- [x] Daily food log view grouped by category

---

## 0.6.0 — Recipe Library ✓
*Goal: users can browse and view saved recipes.*

- [x] Recipe card list with name, prep time, and thumbnail
- [x] Recipe detail page: ingredients, step-by-step instructions, prep time

- [x] SQLite persistence for user recipes (migration v5)

---

## 0.8.0 — Exercise Planner & Logger ~~DEPRECATED~~
*Shipped in commit 8910d83 but subsequently removed from scope. Exercise tracking added complexity without sufficient user value at this stage. All exercise_plan / exercise_log DB tables and associated files are considered inactive.*

- [x] DB migration v7: `exercise_plan` + `exercise_log` tables (committed)
- [x] `useExerciseLog.ts`, `ExerciseTab.tsx`, `ExerciseLogModal.tsx` (committed then deprecated)
- [x] `ExercisePlanWeek.tsx`, `ExercisePlanModal.tsx` (committed then deprecated)
- **Status: deprecated. Files not wired into active UI. Will not be carried forward.**

---

## 0.9.0 — Progress Hub ✓
*Goal: visual history of body changes and trends.*

- [x] Progress photo upload (date-stamped)
- [x] Side-by-side photo comparison (pick two dates)
- [x] Trend charts: weight, average sleep, daily water — all on one screen
- [x] Basic stats summary (current weight, 7-day avg sleep, weekly water avg)

---

## 0.9.1 — Dashboard Home ✓
*Goal: Home tab shows a live at-a-glance summary of today's data.*

- [x] Today's stats row: current weight, water progress, last night's sleep
- [x] Weight mini-chart (last 7 entries, reuses `WeightChart`)
- [x] Water ring widget (reuses `WaterRing`)
- [x] Today's meals preview: breakfast / lunch / dinner / snacks entry count
- [x] Greeting header with current date

---

## 0.9.2 — Quick-Action Shortcuts ~~SKIPPED~~
*Descoped. The dashboard already links directly to the Track tab; a duplicate action grid adds UI noise without meaningful value. Skipped to keep scope lean for 1.0.0.*

---

## 0.9.3 — Profile + Settings Page ✓
*Goal: collect personal data to unlock derived health metrics and personalise the app.*

- [x] DB migration v8: `settings` key-value SQLite table (profile + preferences)
- [x] `src/hooks/useProfile.ts`: `useProfile` hook (read/write profile + prefs); pure utils: `computeBMI`, `computeBMR`, `computeTDEE`, `bmiCategory`, `ageFromDob`
- [x] `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`: About Me (name, DOB, sex, height, activity, goal) + Preferences (weight unit, water goal) + Derived Metrics (BMI with category, BMR, TDEE) + App Info
- [x] `src/pages/Home.tsx`: person-icon button in toolbar → pushes ProfilePage; greeting personalised with first name; BMI + category shown under weight stat
- [x] `src/App.tsx`: route `/tabs/profile` wired to `ProfilePage`
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts`: `personCircleOutline` declared

---

## 0.9.4 — Calorie Estimation + Nutrition on Recipes ✓
*Goal: basic nutritional awareness in food log and recipe detail.*

- [x] Food log entry modal gains optional kcal field (stored in `food_entries` via migration v9)
- [x] Today's food summary card shows total kcal logged
- [x] Recipe detail page shows estimated kcal per serving (editable field on recipe form)
- [x] Recipe kcal stored in `recipes` table (migration v9 adds `kcal_per_serving` column)

---

## 0.9.5 — Recipe → Food Log Link ✓
*Goal: users can log a recipe directly as a meal entry.*

- [x] "Log as meal" button in `RecipeDetailModal` footer
- [x] Tapping it opens an inline meal-slot picker (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack chips)
- [x] Meal slot selectable before confirming; entry saved to today's food log
- [x] Note pre-filled with `{emoji} {recipe name}`; kcal pre-filled from recipe if set
- [x] Toast confirmation shown on success

---

## 0.9.6 — Push Notification Reminders ✓
*Goal: opt-in reminders to keep daily habits consistent — 10 channels across health, meals, and planning.*

- [x] `@capacitor/local-notifications` installed and Android notification channel created (`patty-reminders`)
- [x] `src/hooks/useNotifications.ts` — 10 `NotifChannel` definitions; prefs persisted to SQLite `settings` table; `toggleChannel` / `setChannelTime` / `enableAll` / `disableAll`; `requestPermission`; `checkPermissions` on load
- [x] `src/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx` — dedicated full-screen page; permission banner; master enable-all toggle; three sections (Health Tracking, Meal Logging, Planning); per-channel toggle + time picker shown when enabled
- [x] `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` — "Notifications" nav row (with `notificationsOutline` icon + chevron) pushes `NotificationsPage`
- [x] `src/App.tsx` — `/tabs/notifications` route added
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts` — `notificationsOutline`, `alarmOutline` declared

**10 channels:**
| Channel | Default | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| ⚖️ Weigh-in | 07:30 | Daily |
| 💧 Hydration check (morning) | 10:00 | Daily |
| 💧 Hydration check (afternoon) | 14:00 | Daily |
| 💧 Hydration check (evening) | 17:00 | Daily |
| 😴 Sleep log reminder | 22:00 | Daily |
| 🍳 Breakfast log | 08:30 | Daily |
| 🥗 Lunch log | 13:00 | Daily |
| 🍽️ Dinner log | 19:00 | Daily |
| 📸 Weekly progress photo | 09:00 | Sundays |
| 📅 Weekly meal plan | 18:00 | Sundays |

---

## 0.9.7 — Data Persistence Audit ✓
*Goal: all features store data consistently and reliably.*

- [x] Audit every hook — all user data confirmed to use SQLite (no in-memory-only state)
- [x] Daily water goal migrated from `localStorage` to the `settings` table (`pref_water_goal_ml`)
- [x] Weight unit preference already in `settings` table (`pref_weight_unit`, completed in 0.9.3)
- [x] Notification preferences already in `settings` table (completed in 0.9.6)
- [x] DB migrations v1–v9 verified clean (TypeScript compiles; no migration errors at runtime)

---

## 0.9.8 — UI Polish Pass ✓
*Goal: the app looks and feels finished.*

- [x] Consistent loading skeletons on all data-fetching tabs (`IonSkeletonText`) — WeightTab, WaterTab, SleepTab, FoodTab, Progress photos
- [x] Empty states reviewed and improved: two-line message + emoji on every tab; SleepTab empty state upgraded with title + body copy
- [x] Error handling: failed DB operations surface a dismissible `IonToast` (WeightTab, WaterTab, SleepTab, FoodTab, Progress)
- [x] Spacing and alignment audit: off-grid values (20px, 12px, 6px) corrected to 8 dp multiples across all stat cards and section headers
- [x] Transitions: tab page entry uses `md-fade-in` on `ion-router-outlet > .ion-page`; cards/items retain staggered `md-fade-up`/`md-fade-in` with MD3 easing tokens
- [x] Long-list pagination: weight history uses `IonInfiniteScroll` (30 rows/page); sleep and water lists are inherently short

---

## 0.9.9 — Capacitor Native Build Prep ✓
*Goal: app is ready to compile as a native Android (and iOS) binary.*

- [x] App icon designed and exported at all required densities (mipmap-*)
- [x] Splash screen configured via `@capacitor/splash-screen`
- [x] `AndroidManifest.xml` permissions audited (camera, notifications, storage)
- [x] `capacitor.config.ts` finalised: appId `com.patty.app`, appName `Patty`, webDir `dist`
- [x] `npx cap sync android` runs clean with no warnings
- [x] App launches correctly on Android emulator (API 34 target)
- [ ] iOS scheme verified (`npx cap sync ios`; no build errors in Xcode) — **deferred: requires macOS/Xcode**

---

## 1.0.0 — Release Build
*Goal: signed, shippable APK (and IPA) produced from a clean build.*

- [ ] Version bumped to `1.0.0` in `package.json` and `capacitor.config.ts`
- [ ] `npm run build` produces a clean `dist/` with no TypeScript or lint errors
