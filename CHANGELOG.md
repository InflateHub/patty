# Changelog

---

## [2.1.0] — UX Fixes & Polish
*Goal: resolve the most visible friction points and interaction gaps found in the 2.0.0 build.*

- [x] **Exit confirmation** — Android hardware back button on root tab views now shows an `IonAlert` ("Exit Patty?" / Cancel / Exit) via `useIonAlert` in `BackButtonHandler`
- [x] **Weight stat card clickable** — tapping the "Today" stat card on the Weight tab opens the Add Weight modal directly
- [x] **Sleep stat card clickable** — tapping the "Last Night" stat card on the Sleep tab opens the Add Sleep modal directly
- [x] **Meal section headers clickable** — each meal section heading (Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner / Snack / Brunch / Midnight Meal) opens the Add Food modal pre-filled with that meal type
- [x] **Brunch & Midnight Meal** — `MealType` extended with `'brunch'` and `'midnight_meal'`; both appear in the food log modal chip row, the food tab grouped list (`FoodTab.tsx`), and the recipe log-meal picker (`RecipeDetailModal.tsx`)
- [x] **Segment pill theme colour** — active segment indicator and label now use `--md-primary-container` / `--md-on-primary-container` tokens; follows the user's chosen seed colour automatically
- [x] **Recipe deletion confirmation** — deleting a recipe (seed or custom) shows an `IonAlert` with the recipe name and a destructive Delete button before the delete executes
- [x] **Curved button focus ring** — rectangular browser `outline` removed from `IonSegmentButton`, `IonChip`, and `IonButton`/`IonFabButton`; replaced with a 2 px `box-shadow` ring in `--md-primary` that respects `border-radius`

---

## [2.0.0] — Stable Release & Codebase Cleanup
*Goal: mark the app as stable 2.0.0, eliminate all lint errors/warnings, and bump all version strings.*

- [x] **ESLint clean** — 8 errors and 5 warnings resolved across `useAchievementCards`, `useFoodLog`, `useNotifications`, `Achievements`, `MealPlanGrid`, `FoodTab`
- [x] **Unused imports removed** — `IonChip`, `ellipseOutline` in `Achievements.tsx`; `S` import in `FoodTab.tsx`
- [x] **Dead code removed** — unused `mealLabel` function in `FoodTab.tsx`; unread `waterMonthRes` variable in `useAchievementCards.ts`
- [x] **Type fixes** — `let` → `const` for `storedPhotoUri` in `useFoodLog.ts`; `eslint-disable` comments moved to the correct lines in `useNotifications.ts`
- [x] **Hook deps corrected** — `dates` added to `useEffect` deps in `MealPlanGrid.tsx`; `gam` added to `openBadgeDetail` useCallback deps
- [x] **Version bumped to 2.0.0** — `package.json`, `android/app/build.gradle` (versionCode 3, versionName 2.0.0), `ProfilePage.tsx` App Info card, all page-level version comments

---

## [1.8.1] — Achievements Reorder, Badge Modal & Week Plan Fix
*Goal: rearrange the Achievements page for a better flow, give badges their own shareable modal, and remove the visible scrollbar in the Week Plan.*

- [x] **Section order**: Habit Rings → Weight Journey → Share Achievements → Gamification
- [x] **Habit Rings**: removed external "7-Day Habits" section title (card's own header retained)
- [x] **Weight Journey**: first (newest) photo card shows no delta; delta (± change) only appears from the second entry onward
- [x] **Share Achievements**: removed the label row (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly / Lifetime) below the card carousel
- [x] **Gamification**: removed "Gamification" card title; badges moved into a dedicated full-screen modal with a Share Badges button (captures badge grid as image)
- [x] **Fix – Week Plan scrollbar**: day-strip horizontal scrollbar hidden on all platforms via `.scroll-no-bar` CSS utility class (webkit + Firefox)

---

## [1.8.0] — Landing Page Deployed to GitHub Pages
*Goal: `https://inflatehub.github.io/patty` is live and auto-deployed on every push to `main`.*

- [x] **GitHub Actions workflow** (`pages.yml`): on push to `main` (when `docs/**` changes), deploys `docs/` to GitHub Pages via `actions/deploy-pages@v4`; also supports manual `workflow_dispatch`
- [x] **`CNAME`** — custom domain `patty.saranmahadev.in`; all OG/sitemap URLs updated to match
- [x] **`sitemap.xml`** added to `docs/` with canonical URL `https://patty.saranmahadev.in/`
- [x] **`robots.txt`** added — allows all crawlers, references sitemap
- [x] **Download button** links to `github.com/InflateHub/patty/releases/latest` — always points to the newest APK
- [x] **Open Graph + Twitter Card** meta tags for social sharing

---

## [1.7.0] — App Landing Page
*Goal: a polished marketing webpage for Patty exists as a static site in the repo.*

- [x] **`docs/`** folder created as GitHub Pages source
- [x] **`docs/index.html`** — single-page, self-contained HTML + CSS landing page:
  - Sticky **nav bar** with logo, anchor links, and Download CTA
  - **Hero section**: large title, "Desire. Commit. Achieve." tagline, CSS phone mockup with animated floating stat cards, feature badge chips
  - **Stats banner**: 5 app highlights (10+ habits, 12 recipes, 8 notification channels, 5 levels, 100% local)
  - **Features grid**: 9 feature cards — Health Tracking, Recipes & Meal Planning, Achievements & Gamification, Privacy & Security, Personalisation, Smart Reminders, Progress Photos, Health Metrics, Onboarding
  - **How it works**: 4-step sequence (Download → Track → Plan → Celebrate)
  - **Screenshots section**: 6 CSS phone screen mockups (Home, Weight, Water, Recipes, Achievements, Profile)
  - **Privacy callout**: 4 privacy pillars with shield visual
  - **Theming callout**: 8 palette swatches
  - **Download CTA** section
  - **Footer**: brand, app links, project links, legal, copyright
- [x] **MD3 Patty palette** implemented via CSS custom properties (`:root` tokens + `@media prefers-color-scheme: dark` overrides)
- [x] **Mobile-responsive** layout — flexbox + CSS grid, 375 px → 1440 px
- [x] **Dark mode** support via `prefers-color-scheme`
- [x] **Favicon** and **Open Graph** meta tags matching app brand
- [x] **Roboto font** loaded via Google Fonts (matches app typography)
- [x] **Scroll animations** via `IntersectionObserver` — feature, step and screenshot cards fade up on enter
- [x] **`docs/assets/icon.png`** and **`docs/assets/favicon.png`** copied from `public/assets/icon/`

---

## [1.6.0] — Personalisation Theming
*Goal: users pick their own accent colour and the entire MD3 palette re-seeds dynamically; light/dark/system mode toggle; font size control.*

- [x] **`useTheme.ts`** (new hook): `applyTheme(seed, mode, fontSize)` generates a full MD3 tonal palette via `@material/material-color-utilities` and writes all `--md-*` + Ionic tokens inline to `document.documentElement`
- [x] **`SEED_COLOURS`**: 8 curated swatches (Slate Green, Violet, Ocean Blue, Forest, Terracotta, Mauve, Amber, Rose) + freeform custom hex input with live colour preview dot
- [x] **System mode**: injects a `<style id="patty-theme">` with both `:root` light and `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` dark variants — custom seed works correctly in either OS appearance
- [x] **Light / Dark mode**: writes inline styles on `<html>` that beat any `@media` rule — instant forced mode without OS change
- [x] **Font size**: Default (1 rem) / Large (1.0625 rem) / XL (1.125 rem) — scales `--md-body-lg`; all type tokens inherit
- [x] **ProfilePage → Appearance card**: replaces the old single Preferences card with a split Preferences + Appearance card; contains live preview banner, 8 swatches, custom hex input, Mode segment, Text size segment
- [x] **Live preview**: all picker interactions call `applyTheme` immediately without saving; Save button persists to DB
- [x] **`useProfile`** extended: `UserPrefs` gains `themeSeed`, `themeMode`, `fontSize`; `savePrefs` persists all three to `settings` KV
- [x] **App root**: `useTheme()` called in `AppContent` to restore saved theme on every cold start

---

## [1.5.0] — Privacy & Security
*Goal: protect personal health data with PIN / biometric app lock and give users full control over their stored data.*

**App Lock**
- [x] `@aparajita/capacitor-biometric-auth` installed; `useAppLock` hook manages lock state, PIN hash (SHA-256 via Web Crypto API), biometric availability, and Capacitor `App` resume listener
- [x] `LockScreen.tsx`: full-viewport fixed overlay — Patty logo, 4-dot PIN indicator, numeric pad, backspace, shake animation on wrong PIN; no tab content visible underneath
- [x] `PinSetupModal.tsx`: two-step create-and-confirm PIN flow (IonModal); reused for both initial enable and Change PIN
- [x] Lock triggers automatically on app foreground resume when lock is enabled
- [x] Biometric unlock (Face ID / Fingerprint): toggle in ProfilePage; auto-prompts on lock screen mount; only shown when device has biometrics enrolled
- [x] PIN stored as SHA-256 hex in `settings` KV table — never plaintext

**Data Clear (Danger Zone)**
- [x] ProfilePage → **Privacy & Security** card: App Lock toggle, Biometric Unlock toggle (conditional), Change PIN button
- [x] ProfilePage → **Danger Zone** card with three `IonAlert`-confirmed destructive actions:
  - **Clear Logs** — deletes all weight, water, sleep & food entries
  - **Clear Photos** — removes all progress photo files from device storage + nulls `photo_path`
  - **Factory Reset** — wipes all tables + settings, reloads app → Onboarding

---

## [1.4.1] — Bug Fixes + Lifetime Achievement Card
*Goal: fix broken emoji/unicode rendering across Notifications, WeightTab and ShareCards; add Lifetime shareable card; update Achievements tab icon.*

- [x] **Unicode fixes**: replaced literal `\uXXXX` escape sequences in JSX text nodes (NotificationsPage, ShareCard) with actual UTF-8 emoji/punctuation — fixes `\UD83D\UDCA7 HYDRATION` and `0 days \uD83D\uDD25` display bugs
- [x] **WeightTab mojibake**: fixed `â€"`, `Â·`, `â€¦` garbled characters (UTF-8 bytes mis-read as Latin-1) — em-dash, middle-dot and ellipsis now render correctly
- [x] **Lifetime Card**: 5th shareable card (`LifetimeShareCard`) added to the achievements page-snap scroll — shows all-time totals, best streak, days on journey, level, and total weight change since day one
- [x] **Tab icon**: Achievements tab now uses `trophyOutline` instead of `trendingUpOutline`

---

## [1.4.0] — Achievements Page Redesign
*Goal: transform the Progress tab into a social-ready achievements screen.*

- [x] Tab renamed Progress → Achievements
- [x] Weight Photo Marquee: mandatory photo on weigh-in (two-step modal in WeightTab), horizontal hero scroll (newest first), delta chips (green = lost, amber = gained), fullscreen tap to expand
- [x] Shareable Cards: four 400×600 gradient cards (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly); page-snap horizontal scroll; per-card share button captures image via `html-to-image`, writes to cache, shares via `@capacitor/share`; web fallback: `navigator.share` or download
- [x] Gamification Card: XP bar (earns XP for each habit logged), 5 levels (Seedling→Legend), current/best streak counters, 6 milestone dots, badge shelf (8 badges)
- [x] Habit Rings: 7-day × 4-habit dot grid (Weight / Water / Sleep / Food); today highlighted
- [x] Trend Charts removed
- [x] DB migration v12: `ALTER TABLE weight_entries ADD COLUMN photo_path TEXT`
- [x] `useWeightLog`: two-step photo save (FS) + `startingEntry` exposed; `useGamification` and `useAchievementCards` hooks created
- [x] `src/progress/ShareCard.tsx`: `DailyShareCard`, `WeeklyShareCard`, `MonthlyShareCard`, `YearlyShareCard` (all `React.forwardRef`)
- [x] `src/pages/Achievements.tsx` created; `Progress.tsx` retained but no longer routed
- [x] `html-to-image` + `@capacitor/share` installed

---

## [1.3.0] — Notification System Redesigned
*Goal: smarter, more actionable notification experience that spans the whole day without being annoying.*

- [x] **Weight** — default reminder time changed to 08:00 (was 07:30); label updated to "Weigh-in reminder"
- [x] **Water** — replaced 3 hardcoded slots (morning/afternoon/evening) with a frequency-based system: user picks 1–8 reminders/day + day-window start/end; slots auto-distributed evenly; each slot individually editable; "Reset to even spacing" chip clears overrides; IDs 120–127
- [x] **Sleep log** — changed from bedtime nag at 22:00 to morning prompt at 08:30: "Good morning! How did you sleep?" uses ☀️ emoji
- [x] **Weekly check-in** — new channel `weekly_checkin` (notifId 111, Mondays 09:00): "New week, fresh goals. Check your meal plan and start the week strong!"
- [x] **Engagement nudges** (new `engage` section, notifIds 112–114):
  - `morning_boost` (⚡ 08:30) — 30 min after weigh-in; cascades when weigh-in time changes
  - `midday_nudge` (🌟 13:30) — 30 min after lunch_log; cascades when lunch time changes
  - `evening_reflect` (🌙 19:30) — 30 min after dinner_log; cascades when dinner time changes
- [x] **`useNotifications.ts`** — full rewrite: `WaterFreqSettings` type; `distributeWaterSlots()` exported; `toggleWater / setWaterCount / setWaterWindow / setWaterSlotTime / resetWaterSpacing` actions; `getEngageTime()` helper; `waterFreqRef` + `statesRef` prevent stale closures; `patty-engage` Android channel added
- [x] **`NotificationsPage.tsx`** — full redesign: Water card with stepper (−/+), dual time-pickers for window, per-slot time inputs with "edited" badge and Reset chip; Engagement card shows derived time and linked-reminder label; Health/Meals/Planning cards retain toggle + time-picker pattern; master toggle count updated to include water group
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts` — `refreshOutline` declared
- [x] `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` — version bumped to 1.3.0

---

## [1.2.0] — Onboarding
*Goal: first-launch flow that collects profile data so the app is immediately personalised.*

- [x] **Startup gate** — `StartupGate` component in `App.tsx` reads `onboarding_complete` from SQLite on mount; routes to `/onboarding` (first launch) or `/tabs/home` (returning user); shows Patty logo spinner while resolving
- [x] **Welcome screen** — full-screen `--md-primary-container` hero; 🥗 logo + **"Patty"** wordmark + **"Desire. Commit. Achieve."** tagline; four feature cards fly in with staggered `ob-slide-up` animation (Track Everything / Plan Your Meals / See Your Progress / Stay Consistent); **Get Started →** pill button fades in last
- [x] **Step 1 — Tell us about you** — First Name (required) + Date of Birth (required) text/date inputs
- [x] **Step 2 — Your body metrics** — Height (cm), Starting Weight with kg/lb chip picker, Biological Sex chip group; all three required
- [x] **Step 3 — Main goal** — 5-option card picker (Lose Weight / Maintain / Build Muscle / Better Sleep / General Wellness); selection required
- [x] **Step 4 — Your lifestyle** — Activity level 4-option card picker + daily water goal 4-preset chip row; both required
- [x] **All mandatory** — Next button disabled until every field on the step is filled; no skip
- [x] **4-dot progress indicator** — active dot expands to pill (24px); completed dots tinted `--md-primary-container`
- [x] **Save on Step 4** — writes all 9 profile/pref keys + `onboarding_complete = '1'` to `settings` table; inserts starting weight into `weight_entries`
- [x] **Celebration screen** — CSS confetti (`ob-confetti` / `confetti-fall` keyframes, 22 pieces, 8 MD3-palette colours); 🎉 check circle pop-in; personalised headline; **Let's Go →** routes to `/tabs/home`
- [x] `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` — new file (~784 lines)
- [x] `src/pages/OnboardingPage.css` — keyframes: `ob-fade-in`, `ob-slide-up`, `ob-pop-in`, `confetti-fall`; class hooks for all animated elements
- [x] `src/App.tsx` — `StartupGate` + `/onboarding` route + outer `IonRouterOutlet#main-outlet` wrapping `TabShell`

---

## [1.1.0] — UI Polish & Core Fixes
*Goal: resolve the most visible UX friction points in the shipped 1.0.5 build.*

- [x] **Fancy bottom bar** — `ion-tab-bar` height 60 → 80px; hard `border-top` replaced with MD3 tonal box-shadow elevation; active indicator `top` adjusted to 10px; `--color-selected` updated to `--md-on-primary-container` (matches indicator fill); label scale set to `--md-label-sm` weight 500
- [x] **Smooth splash transition** — `capacitor.config.ts`: `SplashScreen.fadeOutDuration: 300` so the native splash cross-fades out over 300 ms instead of cutting abruptly; pairs with the existing `md-fade-in` CSS entry animation on `ion-router-outlet > .ion-page`
- [x] **Track page contextual FAB** — single `<IonFab>` lives in `Track.tsx`; icon changes per sub-tab (`scaleOutline` / `waterOutline` / `moonOutline` / `fastFoodOutline`); clicking increments `fabTrigger` which each tab listens to via `useEffect`; tab switch resets `fabTrigger` to 0 so the new tab never auto-opens; Sleep FAB disabled when `alreadyLogged` (communicated back via `onAlreadyLoggedChange` prop)
- [x] **Delete seed recipes** — migration v11: `deleted_seed_recipes (id TEXT PK)` table; `useRecipes` fetches deleted IDs and filters `RECIPES` on load; `deleteSeedRecipe(id)` inserts to the table; `Recipes.tsx` `handleDelete` dispatches to `deleteRecipe` or `deleteSeedRecipe` based on `recipe.custom`; `RecipeDetailModal` `onDelete` now always supplied (trash icon visible for all recipes)

---

## [1.0.5] — Photo filesystem storage
*Goal: stop storing image data as base64 blobs in SQLite; write each photo to the device filesystem and store only a path string in the database.*

- [x] `@capacitor/filesystem@8.1.2` installed
- [x] `src/utils/photoStorage.ts`: new shared utility — `savePhotoFile` (writes raw base64 to `Directory.Data`), `loadPhotoFile` (reads back as data URL; handles both native base64 string and browser Blob), `deletePhotoFile` (silent if absent)
- [x] Migration v10: `DROP + recreate progress_photos` with `photo_path TEXT NOT NULL` (pre-production wipe of base64 blobs); `ALTER TABLE food_entries ADD COLUMN photo_path TEXT`
- [x] `useProgressPhotos.ts`: `addPhoto` writes to `progress_photos/` folder; `load` reads each file via FS; `deletePhoto` removes the file before the DB row
- [x] `useFoodLog.ts`: `addEntry` writes photo to `food_photos/` folder, stores `photo_path`, leaves `photo_uri` null in DB; `loadAll` reads FS for entries with `photo_path`; `deleteEntry` also deletes the photo file
- [x] `FoodTab.tsx`: replace `<input type="file">` + `handlePhotoChange` with Capacitor Camera API — same **Take Photo** / **Gallery** two-button pattern as Progress.tsx; removes `fileInputRef`, `fileToDataUri`, `useRef`
- [x] No display-layer changes — both hooks still return `photo_uri` as a data URL to consumers

---

## [1.0.4] — Progress Photo: Take Photo / Select From Gallery
*Goal: replace the single file-input tap area with explicit camera and gallery actions, backed by the Capacitor Camera API with permission handling.*

- [x] Install `@capacitor/camera@8.0.1`
- [x] `AndroidManifest.xml`: add `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission (`android:minSdkVersion="33"`) for gallery access on Android 13+
- [x] `Progress.tsx`: replace `fileRef` / `handleFileChange` / single tap zone with `capturePhoto(source)` using `CameraResultType.DataUrl`
- [x] Add-photo modal now shows a preview area + two explicit buttons: **Take Photo** (`CameraSource.Camera`) and **Gallery** (`CameraSource.Photos`)
- [x] Permission flow: `Camera.checkPermissions()` before each action; if `'denied'` show toast; if `'prompt'` call `Camera.requestPermissions()` and re-check before proceeding
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts`: declare `albumsOutline` (gallery icon) + `cameraOutline` was already declared

---

## [1.0.3] — Sync audit: two bugs fixed
*Goal: close two bugs found during deep sync analysis.*

- [x] `Home.tsx`: move `useProfile()` call above `useIonViewWillEnter` — fixes `reloadProfile` being referenced before declaration (const TDZ violation)
- [x] `FoodTab.tsx`: add `useIonViewWillEnter` + `reload` — fixes stale food entries when a recipe is logged from the Recipes tab while FoodTab is the active sub-tab

**Full sync status post-1.0.3:**
- Home: all 5 data hooks reload on tab entry ✅
- Progress: photos + trends reload on tab entry ✅
- Track sub-tabs: Weight/Water/Sleep — only mutated from their own tab, no cross-page stale risk ✅
- Track FoodTab: reloads on tab entry ✅ (food can also be logged from Recipes)
- Plan: useMealPlan reloads after every assign/clear, only mutated from Plan ✅
- Recipes: useRecipes only mutated from Recipes; useFoodLog write-only (no display) ✅
- ProfilePage / NotificationsPage: push routes — fresh mount every visit ✅

---

## [1.0.2] — Full live-refresh coverage
*Goal: every tab refreshes its data on entry — no stale reads anywhere in the app.*

- [x] `useProfile.ts`: extract load into `useCallback loadAll`; expose `reload: loadAll`
- [x] `useProgressPhotos.ts` / `useTrends.ts`: already exposed `refresh` — no change needed
- [x] `Progress.tsx`: import `useIonViewWillEnter`; call `refreshPhotos` + `refreshTrends` on tab entry
- [x] `Home.tsx`: add `reloadProfile` to existing `useIonViewWillEnter` block

---

## [1.0.1] — Live Home Refresh
*Goal: Home dashboard reflects the latest data immediately when switching back to the tab — no restart required.*

- [x] `useSleepLog.ts`: expose `reload` in return value
- [x] `useFoodLog.ts`: expose `reload` in return value
- [x] `Home.tsx`: import `useIonViewWillEnter`; call `reloadWeight`, `reloadWater`, `reloadSleep`, `reloadFood` on every tab entry

---

## [1.0.0] — Release Build
*Goal: signed, shippable APK produced from a clean build.*

- [x] `package.json` version bumped to `1.0.0`
- [x] `android/app/build.gradle`: `versionCode 1`, `versionName "1.0.0"`, `signingConfigs.release` wired from `keystore.properties`
- [x] `android/.gitignore` updated: `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `keystore.properties` excluded from version control

- [x] `@capacitor/android`, `@capacitor/ios`, `@capacitor/splash-screen` installed
- [x] `@capacitor/assets` installed (dev); `resources/icon.png` + `resources/splash.png` populated from 1024×1024 source image
- [x] `npx @capacitor/assets generate --android` — all mipmap densities (ldpi → xxxhdpi) + adaptive-icon XMLs + splash all densities generated
- [x] `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — added `CAMERA`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `USE_EXACT_ALARM`, `VIBRATE`; `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` gated to `maxSdkVersion="32"`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` gated to `maxSdkVersion="28"`
- [x] `npx cap add android` — Android project scaffolded; 3 Capacitor plugins detected
- [x] `npx cap sync android` — clean sync, no warnings
- [ ] iOS deferred — requires macOS/Xcode; will run `npx cap sync ios` on build machine

---

## [0.9.8-pass-b] — UI Polish: Spacing, Transitions & Infinite Scroll
*Goal: 8 dp grid compliance, MD3 page entry animation, paginated weight history.*

- [x] `src/theme/md3.css` — `ion-router-outlet > .ion-page` fade-in entry animation (`md-fade-in`, `--md-duration-sm`, `--md-easing-decelerate`)
- [x] `src/theme/md3.css` — `ion-card` margin corrected from 12px to 8px (8 dp grid)
- [x] `src/theme/md3.css` — `.md-section-header` padding-top corrected from 20px to 16px
- [x] `src/track/WeightTab.tsx` — stat card padding `20px 0 12px` → `24px 0 16px`; `marginTop 6` → `8`; `IonInfiniteScroll` added to history list (page size 30)
- [x] `src/track/SleepTab.tsx` — stat card padding and `marginTop 6` → `8` (quality stars row)
- [x] `src/track/FoodTab.tsx` — today summary card padding `20px 24px` → `16px 24px`
- [x] ROADMAP.md: all six 0.9.8 items checked off

---

## [0.9.8-pass-a] — UI Polish: Skeletons, Empty States & Error Toasts
*Goal: eliminate blank flash on load, improve empty-state copy, and surface DB errors as dismissible toasts.*

- [x] `src/track/WeightTab.tsx` — skeleton stat card + history rows while `loading`; `IonToast` on save/delete failure
- [x] `src/track/WaterTab.tsx` — skeleton history rows while `waterLoading`; `IonToast` on add/delete failure; quick-add error no longer silently swallowed
- [x] `src/track/SleepTab.tsx` — skeleton stat card while `loading`; two-line empty state; `IonToast` on delete failure
- [x] `src/track/FoodTab.tsx` — skeleton summary + grouped meal sections while `loading`; `IonToast` on save/delete failure
- [x] `src/pages/Progress.tsx` — skeleton photo strip (3 placeholder tiles) while `photosLoading`; `IonToast` on photo save failure

---

## [0.9.7] — Data Persistence Audit
*Goal: all features store data consistently and reliably.*

- [x] Hook audit — all data hooks (weight, water, sleep, food, recipes, meal plan, progress photos, notifications) confirmed fully SQLite-backed; zero in-memory-only persistence
- [x] `src/hooks/useWaterLog.ts` — daily goal migrated from `localStorage` (`patty_water_goal_ml`) to `settings` table (`pref_water_goal_ml`); `setDailyGoal` now async; `loadGoal` reads from SQLite on mount
- [x] `src/hooks/useDailySummary.ts` — `waterGoalMl` now read from `settings` table instead of `localStorage`; no new migration needed (`settings` table exists from v8)
- [x] Weight unit preference (`pref_weight_unit`) and notification prefs already in `settings` table from 0.9.3 / 0.9.6 respectively — confirmed
- [x] `localStorage` fully eliminated from all source files

---
