## [1.3.0] — Notification System Redesigned
*Goal: smarter, more actionable notification experience that spans the whole day without being annoying.*

- [x] **Weight** — default reminder time changed to 08:00 (was 07:30); label updated to "Weigh-in reminder"
- [x] **Water** — replaced 3 hardcoded slots (morning/afternoon/evening) with a frequency-based system: user picks 1–8 reminders/day + day-window start/end; slots auto-distributed evenly; each slot individually editable; "Reset to even spacing" chip clears overrides; IDs 120–127
- [x] **Sleep log** — changed from bedtime nag at 22:00 to morning prompt at 08:30: "Good morning! How did you sleep?" uses ☀️ emoji
- [x] **Weekly check-in** — new channel `weekly_checkin` (notifId 111, Mondays 09:00): "New week, fresh goals. Check your meal plan and start the week strong!"
- [x] **Engagement nudges** (new `engage` section, notifIds 112–114):
  - `morning_boost` (⚡ 08:30) — 30 min after weigh-in; cascades when weigh-in time changes
  - `midday_nudge` (🌟 13:30) — 30 min after lunch_log; cascades when lunch time changes
  - `evening_reflect` (🌙 19:30) — 30 min after dinner_log; cascades when dinner time changes
- [x] **`useNotifications.ts`** — full rewrite: `WaterFreqSettings` type; `distributeWaterSlots()` exported; `toggleWater / setWaterCount / setWaterWindow / setWaterSlotTime / resetWaterSpacing` actions; `getEngageTime()` helper; `waterFreqRef` + `statesRef` prevent stale closures; `patty-engage` Android channel added
- [x] **`NotificationsPage.tsx`** — full redesign: Water card with stepper (−/+), dual time-pickers for window, per-slot time inputs with "edited" badge and Reset chip; Engagement card shows derived time and linked-reminder label; Health/Meals/Planning cards retain toggle + time-picker pattern; master toggle count updated to include water group
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts` — `refreshOutline` declared
- [x] `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` — version bumped to 1.3.0

---

## [1.2.0] — Onboarding
*Goal: first-launch flow that collects profile data so the app is immediately personalised.*

- [x] **Startup gate** — `StartupGate` component in `App.tsx` reads `onboarding_complete` from SQLite on mount; routes to `/onboarding` (first launch) or `/tabs/home` (returning user); shows Patty logo spinner while resolving
- [x] **Welcome screen** — full-screen `--md-primary-container` hero; 🥗 logo + **"Patty"** wordmark + **"Desire. Commit. Achieve."** tagline; four feature cards fly in with staggered `ob-slide-up` animation (Track Everything / Plan Your Meals / See Your Progress / Stay Consistent); **Get Started →** pill button fades in last
- [x] **Step 1 — Tell us about you** — First Name (required) + Date of Birth (required) text/date inputs
- [x] **Step 2 — Your body metrics** — Height (cm), Starting Weight with kg/lb chip picker, Biological Sex chip group; all three required
- [x] **Step 3 — Main goal** — 5-option card picker (Lose Weight / Maintain / Build Muscle / Better Sleep / General Wellness); selection required
- [x] **Step 4 — Your lifestyle** — Activity level 4-option card picker + daily water goal 4-preset chip row; both required
- [x] **All mandatory** — Next button disabled until every field on the step is filled; no skip
- [x] **4-dot progress indicator** — active dot expands to pill (24px); completed dots tinted `--md-primary-container`
- [x] **Save on Step 4** — writes all 9 profile/pref keys + `onboarding_complete = '1'` to `settings` table; inserts starting weight into `weight_entries`
- [x] **Celebration screen** — CSS confetti (`ob-confetti` / `confetti-fall` keyframes, 22 pieces, 8 MD3-palette colours); 🎉 check circle pop-in; personalised headline; **Let's Go →** routes to `/tabs/home`
- [x] `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx` — new file (~784 lines)
- [x] `src/pages/OnboardingPage.css` — keyframes: `ob-fade-in`, `ob-slide-up`, `ob-pop-in`, `confetti-fall`; class hooks for all animated elements
- [x] `src/App.tsx` — `StartupGate` + `/onboarding` route + outer `IonRouterOutlet#main-outlet` wrapping `TabShell`

---

## [1.1.0] — UI Polish & Core Fixes
*Goal: resolve the most visible UX friction points in the shipped 1.0.5 build.*

- [x] **Fancy bottom bar** — `ion-tab-bar` height 60 → 80px; hard `border-top` replaced with MD3 tonal box-shadow elevation; active indicator `top` adjusted to 10px; `--color-selected` updated to `--md-on-primary-container` (matches indicator fill); label scale set to `--md-label-sm` weight 500
- [x] **Smooth splash transition** — `capacitor.config.ts`: `SplashScreen.fadeOutDuration: 300` so the native splash cross-fades out over 300 ms instead of cutting abruptly; pairs with the existing `md-fade-in` CSS entry animation on `ion-router-outlet > .ion-page`
- [x] **Track page contextual FAB** — single `<IonFab>` lives in `Track.tsx`; icon changes per sub-tab (`scaleOutline` / `waterOutline` / `moonOutline` / `fastFoodOutline`); clicking increments `fabTrigger` which each tab listens to via `useEffect`; tab switch resets `fabTrigger` to 0 so the new tab never auto-opens; Sleep FAB disabled when `alreadyLogged` (communicated back via `onAlreadyLoggedChange` prop)
- [x] **Delete seed recipes** — migration v11: `deleted_seed_recipes (id TEXT PK)` table; `useRecipes` fetches deleted IDs and filters `RECIPES` on load; `deleteSeedRecipe(id)` inserts to the table; `Recipes.tsx` `handleDelete` dispatches to `deleteRecipe` or `deleteSeedRecipe` based on `recipe.custom`; `RecipeDetailModal` `onDelete` now always supplied (trash icon visible for all recipes)

---

## [1.0.5] — Photo filesystem storage
*Goal: stop storing image data as base64 blobs in SQLite; write each photo to the device filesystem and store only a path string in the database.*

- [x] `@capacitor/filesystem@8.1.2` installed
- [x] `src/utils/photoStorage.ts`: new shared utility — `savePhotoFile` (writes raw base64 to `Directory.Data`), `loadPhotoFile` (reads back as data URL; handles both native base64 string and browser Blob), `deletePhotoFile` (silent if absent)
- [x] Migration v10: `DROP + recreate progress_photos` with `photo_path TEXT NOT NULL` (pre-production wipe of base64 blobs); `ALTER TABLE food_entries ADD COLUMN photo_path TEXT`
- [x] `useProgressPhotos.ts`: `addPhoto` writes to `progress_photos/` folder; `load` reads each file via FS; `deletePhoto` removes the file before the DB row
- [x] `useFoodLog.ts`: `addEntry` writes photo to `food_photos/` folder, stores `photo_path`, leaves `photo_uri` null in DB; `loadAll` reads FS for entries with `photo_path`; `deleteEntry` also deletes the photo file
- [x] `FoodTab.tsx`: replace `<input type="file">` + `handlePhotoChange` with Capacitor Camera API — same **Take Photo** / **Gallery** two-button pattern as Progress.tsx; removes `fileInputRef`, `fileToDataUri`, `useRef`
- [x] No display-layer changes — both hooks still return `photo_uri` as a data URL to consumers

---

## [1.0.4] — Progress Photo: Take Photo / Select From Gallery
*Goal: replace the single file-input tap area with explicit camera and gallery actions, backed by the Capacitor Camera API with permission handling.*

- [x] Install `@capacitor/camera@8.0.1`
- [x] `AndroidManifest.xml`: add `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission (`android:minSdkVersion="33"`) for gallery access on Android 13+
- [x] `Progress.tsx`: replace `fileRef` / `handleFileChange` / single tap zone with `capturePhoto(source)` using `CameraResultType.DataUrl`
- [x] Add-photo modal now shows a preview area + two explicit buttons: **Take Photo** (`CameraSource.Camera`) and **Gallery** (`CameraSource.Photos`)
- [x] Permission flow: `Camera.checkPermissions()` before each action; if `'denied'` show toast; if `'prompt'` call `Camera.requestPermissions()` and re-check before proceeding
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts`: declare `albumsOutline` (gallery icon) + `cameraOutline` was already declared

---

## [1.0.3] — Sync audit: two bugs fixed
*Goal: close two bugs found during deep sync analysis.*

- [x] `Home.tsx`: move `useProfile()` call above `useIonViewWillEnter` — fixes `reloadProfile` being referenced before declaration (const TDZ violation)
- [x] `FoodTab.tsx`: add `useIonViewWillEnter` + `reload` — fixes stale food entries when a recipe is logged from the Recipes tab while FoodTab is the active sub-tab

**Full sync status post-1.0.3:**
- Home: all 5 data hooks reload on tab entry ✅
- Progress: photos + trends reload on tab entry ✅
- Track sub-tabs: Weight/Water/Sleep — only mutated from their own tab, no cross-page stale risk ✅
- Track FoodTab: reloads on tab entry ✅ (food can also be logged from Recipes)
- Plan: useMealPlan reloads after every assign/clear, only mutated from Plan ✅
- Recipes: useRecipes only mutated from Recipes; useFoodLog write-only (no display) ✅
- ProfilePage / NotificationsPage: push routes — fresh mount every visit ✅

---

## [1.0.2] — Full live-refresh coverage
*Goal: every tab refreshes its data on entry — no stale reads anywhere in the app.*

- [x] `useProfile.ts`: extract load into `useCallback loadAll`; expose `reload: loadAll`
- [x] `useProgressPhotos.ts` / `useTrends.ts`: already exposed `refresh` — no change needed
- [x] `Progress.tsx`: import `useIonViewWillEnter`; call `refreshPhotos` + `refreshTrends` on tab entry
- [x] `Home.tsx`: add `reloadProfile` to existing `useIonViewWillEnter` block

---

## [1.0.1] — Live Home Refresh
*Goal: Home dashboard reflects the latest data immediately when switching back to the tab — no restart required.*

- [x] `useSleepLog.ts`: expose `reload` in return value
- [x] `useFoodLog.ts`: expose `reload` in return value
- [x] `Home.tsx`: import `useIonViewWillEnter`; call `reloadWeight`, `reloadWater`, `reloadSleep`, `reloadFood` on every tab entry

---

## [1.0.0] — Release Build
*Goal: signed, shippable APK produced from a clean build.*

- [x] `package.json` version bumped to `1.0.0`
- [x] `android/app/build.gradle`: `versionCode 1`, `versionName "1.0.0"`, `signingConfigs.release` wired from `keystore.properties`
- [x] `android/.gitignore` updated: `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `keystore.properties` excluded from version control
- [x] Release keystore generated: `patty-release.jks` (alias `patty`, 2048-bit RSA, SHA256withRSA, valid 10000 days)

---

## [0.9.8-pass-b] — UI Polish: Spacing, Transitions & Infinite Scroll
*Goal: 8 dp grid compliance, MD3 page entry animation, paginated weight history.*

---

## [0.9.2] — Quick-Action Shortcuts *(SKIPPED)*
*Descoped. Dashboard already surfaces all key data; a duplicate action grid would add UI noise without meaningful value. Removed from scope to keep the 1.0.0 increment lean.*

---

## [0.8.0] — Exercise Planner & Logger *(DEPRECATED)*
*Shipped in commit `8910d83` but subsequently deprecated. Exercise tracking introduced significant complexity (two new DB tables, five new source files, a new Track segment) without sufficient user value at this stage of the product. The feature is inactive — files are committed but not wired into current navigation.*

- [x] DB migration v7: `exercise_plan` (time-block schedule) + `exercise_log` (completed sessions) tables
- [x] `src/hooks/useExerciseLog.ts` — `addPlan` / `removePlan` / `addSession` / `removeSession`; `useExerciseWeekPlans` for weekly counts
- [x] `src/track/ExerciseTab.tsx` — day navigator, planned blocks, logged sessions, FAB
- [x] `src/track/ExerciseLogModal.tsx` — log a session against a planned block
- [x] `src/plan/ExercisePlanWeek.tsx` + `ExercisePlanModal.tsx` — week grid and block creation modal
- **All above deprecated. Will not be carried forward into 1.0.0.**

---

- [x] `src/components/TrendCharts.tsx` — three stacked Recharts line charts (weight, daily water in L, sleep in hours)
- [x] `src/pages/Progress.tsx` — rewritten: stats summary card, date-stamped photo gallery, FAB to add photo, side-by-side comparison modal, trend charts
- [x] `vite-env.d.ts` — `imageOutline`, `swapHorizontalOutline` declared
- [x] TypeScript clean

---

## [0.4.1] — Daily Alignment + Analytics Foundation
*Goal: align all three trackers to a daily model and lay the data foundation for the Home dashboard.*

- [x] `useWeightLog` — adds `todayEntries` (today-filtered list) and `latestEntry` to return value

- [x] `src/hooks/useDailySummary.ts` — new hook: given a date, queries all three tables and returns `{ weight, waterTotalMl, waterGoalMl, sleep }`
- [x] `WeightTab` — replaces combined chart card with a prominent "Today" stat card (big number or "No entry today") + separate chart card below
- [x] `SleepTab` — stat card now shows "Last Night": duration, quality stars, bed→wake time range; FAB disabled when today/yesterday already logged; `DUPLICATE_DATE` error presented as a user-friendly alert
- [x] TypeScript clean
